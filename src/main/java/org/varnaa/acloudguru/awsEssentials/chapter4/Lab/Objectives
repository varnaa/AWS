Create a VPC
    Create a VPC from scratch (without using the VPC Wizard).
    Set the VPC CIDR to 172.16.0.0/16.
    Create a Public and Private Subnet in Different Availability Zones
    Create a public and private subnet in different Availability Zones using the following IP CIDR addresses:

Public1 subnet in us-east-1a: 172.16.1.0/24
    Private1 subnet in us-east-1b: 172.16.2.0/24

Create Two Network Access Control Lists (NACLs), and Associate Each with the Proper Subnet
    Create a public NACL with inbound rules allowing HTTP and SSH traffic, as well as an outbound rule allowing traffic on port range 1024-65535.
    Associate the public NACL with the public subnet.
    Create a private NACL with an inbound rule allowing SSH traffic with a source of 172.16.1.0/24, as well as an outbound rule allowing traffic on port range 1024-65535.
    Associate the private NACL with the private subnet.

Create an Internet Gateway, and Connect It to the VPC
    Create an internet gateway, and connect it to the VPC.

Create Two Route Tables, and Associate Them with the Correct Subnet
    Create two route tables:
    One for the public subnet with an internet gateway route
    One for the private subnet without an internet gateway route
    For the public route table, create a default route to the internet using the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR notation.
